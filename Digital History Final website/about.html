  <h1>Read me <br>before you examine <br>the network visualization.</h1>
  <p>This network visualization displays the social connections established through poetry, focusing on the central figure, 
    Princess Kishi (also known as Princess Noriko, 949–986). Princess Kishi served as Saiō at the <a href="https://www.bunka.pref.mie.lg.jp/saiku/p0048200001.htm">Saigū institution </a> near 
    <a href="https://www.isejingu.or.jp/en/">the Ise Shrine</a> from 975 to 984. Her mother, <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.us/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=78939;type=101">Saigū no Nyōgo (929–985)</a>, also served in this role from 936 to 945. 
    <br>This data was collected, transcribed, and curated from the poetry data found in Professor Kyoko Tokoro’s article 
    “Ise Saigū Kankei Waka Shūsei Heian Chūki o Chūshin ni shite,” and Professor Takuya Tamagami’s modern translations of poems 
    in the Saigū no Nyōgo Shū (Poetic Anthology of The Saigū Consort, late 10th century) as featured in the book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/23206741">Saigū Nyōgo shū chūshaku</a>.
     <br><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K49sPeKm4jjUDkgjWEMRZBuoL-ZdAAGZ?usp=sharing">My dataset</a> comprises 91 poems by 22 poets, including Kishi herself. These poems are categorized into poetic exchanges, 
     poetry contests, ceremonial poems, and those composed on behalf of Kishi. Connections (edges) between poets (nodes) 
     are further identified by five categories, with one additional category beyond the previous four poem types. 
     When two poets engage in an exchange about a third figure (often Kishi in this study), 
     it is considered an indirect mention of that figure. Similarly, when poets participate in a contest with themes or 
     locations related to a third figure, this also constitutes an indirect mention. The indirect mention is 
     the fifth type of connections. 
    <br> The size of the circles (nodes) in the network map represents the number of poems written by each poet. 
     This means that larger circles indicate poets who have composed a greater number of poems.
    The colors of the circles are defined by the types of their social identities. There is one circle (No.23) in the map that is not a poet but is the recipient of a poem. I counted her as well.
    <br>In this map, Princess Kishi is highlighted in <span style="color: rgb(54, 144, 192);"><b>(Blue)</b></span>, and the other figures are divided into four categories: 
    courtiers, members of the imperial family, attendants, and others. The “courtier” category <span style="color: rgb(27, 158, 119);"><b>(Green)</b></span> refers to 
    people of the aristocracy in the imperial court during the Heian period (794–1185). The “imperial family” category <span style="color: rgb(217, 95, 2);"><b>(Orange)</b></span>
    includes those who are part of the broader imperial family but may not be direct relatives of Kishi. 
    The “attendants” category <span style="color: rgb(231, 41, 138);"><b>(Deep Pink)</b></span> encompasses Kishi’s servants and officials at the Saigū institution. 
    The “others” category <span style="color: rgb(117, 112, 179);"><b>(Purple)</b></span> includes attendants of Kishi’s mother Saigū no Nyōgo and unidentified poets (unknown). 
    <br>The solid lines <b>(—)</b> represent direct connections between two circles, encompassing various interactions such as poetic exchanges, 
    poetry contests, ceremonial poems, and compositions made on behalf of others. The dash-dot <b>(- -- -)</b> lines indicate indirect mentions,
    primarily involving Kishi in this study. The thickness of these lines corresponds to the frequency of each interaction 
    within the dataset, serving as a measure of the weight (significance) of these connections. I marked the two type of lines in different colors in both the light and dark modes to make them easier to distinguish.
