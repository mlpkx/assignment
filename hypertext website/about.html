        <h1>About Japanese Poetry Divination</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p> Welcome to the magical realm of poetry. I hail from 17th-century Japan, a waka poet at heart. 
            <br>During a leisurely journey with friends to the town of Yoshino, I penned a poetic travelogue titled <em>The Journey to Yoshino</em>. It captures our emotions and observations along the way. 
            As time has blessed it, this manuscript now possesses a unique magic, able to tell your luck for the day. Are you ready to join me on this magical journey? During this process, you will follow your own choices, and the poetic magic will reveal your fortune.
