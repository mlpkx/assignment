                <h2>2. Gel Electrophoresis as a Tool for Genotyping</h2>
                    <p>Genes are like instructions in our cells, and they come in different versions called alleles. Imagine alleles as variations of a recipe, like different versions of a chocolate cake recipe. Each person has pairs of alleles for each gene, one inherited from each parent. If both alleles in the pair are the same (like AA or aa), you're "homozygous" for that gene. If the alleles are different (like Aa), you're "heterozygous." Scientists use a technique called gel electrophoresis to separate and analyze these alleles. In this technique, <span class="dna-highlight">DNA</span>fragments (representing alleles) are placed in a gel and subjected to an electric current. The fragments move through the gel at different speeds based on their size and charge. After the process, we see bands on the gel, each representing different alleles. By analyzing the position and number of these bands, scientists can determine which alleles a person has.</p>
