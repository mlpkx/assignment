                <h2>1. Lab Mouse Colony Management</h2>
                    <p>Mouse colony management stands as a fundamental aspect of everyday laboratory operations. Within our virtual lab, we meticulously set up <span class="cage-highlight">breeder cages</span>, facilitating the natural process where male and female mice are paired for mating. Approximately three weeks post-mating, a new generation of mice, affectionately known as a litter of pups, is born. 
                    As these pups mature, significant growth is observed within the first <span class="week-highlight">three weeks</span> of their lives. To uphold the standards of animal welfare, it becomes essential to undertake the process of weaning. This critical step involves carefully <span class="sepa-highlight">separating</span> the baby mice from their parents and relocating them into different cages.</p>
