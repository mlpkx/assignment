                <h2>Lab Mouse Colony Management</h2>
                    <p>Mouse colony management stands as a fundamental aspect of everyday laboratory operations. Within our virtual lab, we meticulously set up breeder cages, facilitating the natural process where male and female mice are paired for mating. Approximately three weeks post-mating, a new generation of mice, affectionately known as a litter of pups, is born. 
                    As these pups mature, significant growth is observed within the first three weeks of their lives. To uphold the highest standards of animal welfare, it becomes essential to undertake the process of weaning. This critical step involves carefully separating the young mice from their parents and relocating them into different cages, categorized by their age. Your task in this interactive module is to assist in this weaning process, ensuring each mouse is placed in the appropriate environment for its stage of life. Engage in this vital aspect of lab life and contribute to the well-being and orderly management of our virtual mouse colony.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please put mice into the right cages.</p>
